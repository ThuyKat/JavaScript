// Object: free of form , mutable,a single entity that stores data items by key.
// properties, methods
// dot/square bracket
// delete myObject.property
//object destructuring : unpack object into variables. Left side: corresponding properties - list of variable names in a bracket- in object-like pattern
//--Right side: existing object that we want to split into variables
//-- dont know how many props are there in objs -> rest pattern
//--dont need to destructure all properties are there in the existing objects
//-- Order is not important as long as names are matched
//-- set other name using colon
//--set default value: value, function call, expression prompt('')
//--use existing variables -> JS understands it is a code block --> wrap it in a parenthesis
//--nested objects: more complex patterns to extract deeper portions
//--pass params as a object --> function destructures them into vars --> assume: function takes an argument
//--- functions donot take args --> make {} default value for object of params--> always something to destructuring
